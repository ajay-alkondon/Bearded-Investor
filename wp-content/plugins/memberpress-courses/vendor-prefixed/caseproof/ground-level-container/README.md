Ground Level Container
======================

The Ground Level Container package is a simple dependency injection container 
implementing the the [PSR-11 Container Interface](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-11/)
intended for usage in WordPress projects built on top of the [Ground Level Framework](https://github.com/caseproof/ground-level-php).

__This package owes a debt for inspiration and implementations via [Pimple](https://github.com/silexphp/Pimple) and [League/Container](https://container.thephpleague.com/).__
